You are about to be directed a simulation. This simulation is described in the accompanying paper and includes three models.  In the following interface, you can choose which model to use, or which variables.  You will have sliders to determine the parameters accompanying the variables, as well as text inputs where you can determine the number of different identities (identity range) as well as number of levels of identity on which the agents will compare (identity compare). In depth explanations of the variables and parameters are provided in the paper.
